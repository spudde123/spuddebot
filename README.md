# spuddebot

Artificial-Overmind branch includes the version from 2019 Artificial Overmind competition.
It doesn't work with the current version of [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2)
and is there just for reference.

Master and develop branches are functional and getting updates. The bot is competing in 
[AI-Arena](https://ai-arena.net/)
and [Probots](https://eschamp.discourse.group/t/probots-2020-season-2-announcement/142).
